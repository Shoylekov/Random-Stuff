This Python script is a web scraper that extracts job postings from a specific website (https://dev.bg/company/jobs/python/) related to Python jobs.
It uses the BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML and requests for making HTTP requests.
The script continues running in an infinite loop, periodically scraping the webpage for new job listings every 10 minutes.
